BINF5507 Assignment 2 - Regression and Classification Models:  

Part 1 of this assignment involved the setup of this GitHub repository. This repository includes the following files: heart disease dataset (csv file), assignment_2_main.ipnyb file, and this README.md file. 

Part 2 of this assignment involved the retrieval of the heart disease csv file. In this case, the heart disease dataset was downloaded from Blackboard and loaded in VS Code. 

Part 3 of this assignment involved the creation and evaluation of regression models (the target column was: 'chol' from the heart disease dataset). In this part, I performed an ElasticNet Regression analysis. R^2 and RMSE values were evaluated. In addition, Seaborn heatmaps were generated using a range of alpha values and l1_ratios. The best RMSE and R^2 values were identified. 

Part 4 of this assignment involved the creation and evaluation of classification models (the target column was: 'num' from the heart disease dataset; binary classification). In this part, I performed a Logistic Regression analysis (using a range of penalty and solver values), followed by a k-NN Classification model (using a range of n_neighbors values). AUROC and AUPRC plots were generated for both models, and evaluation metrics were analyzed. 


**Note: for Parts 3 and 4, appropriate packages (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and sklearn) were loaded, and data wrangling was performed prior to the generation and analysis of regression and classification models.
